Thank you for reaching to my repository for Pxem implementation in shell script with POSIX utilities.

## Usage
Copy *.header, *.middle, *.footer to
the TIO, run as ksh/bash/dash/zsh language.

The *.middle comment describes what to do.

Byte-unit I/O.

## Bugs
Please let me know if you found a behavior
that does not comply with original Pxem specs
or pxemi.7z or rpxem; I may document it on demand.
